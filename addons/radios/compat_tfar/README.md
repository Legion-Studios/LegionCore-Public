ls_radios_compat_tfar
===================

TFAR Compatibility for Legion Studios: Core.

This compatibility is packaged as a sub-addon for organization purposes. The radio displays use control classes defined in TFAR (although they aren't prefixed), meaning that loading this without TFAR would cause missing base class errors.
