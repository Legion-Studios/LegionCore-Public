`ls_gar_rebreather_vest.p3d` had some textures that were seemingly lost in the past. For the `camo1` and `camo2` selections it used `swls_cbrn_gear\data\tubing_co.paa` and `swls_cbrn_gear\data\rbsys_co.paa`, but these textures seem lost to time.

I removed the textures and materials from the p3d itself but left the selections defined in config for people who want to retexture them.
